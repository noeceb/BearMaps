# BearMaps

This project is a Google Maps inspired clone for the UC Berkeley campus. I implemented the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points, and KD-Trees to find the nearest point to the position clicked by the user. I also added tries to imprement an auto-complete search feature.

The rest was created by Alan Yao.
